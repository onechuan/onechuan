## About Me

Hi there! I'm a full-stack developer and open source enthusiast. My favorite tech stack includes:
- Koa.js - I love how lightweight yet powerful Koa is for Node.js web applications. I've used it to build many fast and scalable APIs. 🚀:
- NestJS - For robust backend applications, NestJS helps me leverage TypeScript and OOP principles to write clean, testable code. The CLI is amazing too. 💻:
- Next.js - For frontend work, Next.js supercharges my React apps with SSR, easy routing and deployment. I'm a huge fan of the developer experience. ⚛:
- Vue - If I need a progressive and flexible frontend framework, Vue is my go-to. With its component-based approach, Vue makes building complex UIs a breeze. 🦸🏻‍♀️:
- MySQL - Can't go wrong with a tried and true relational database like MySQL. I use it for all my production apps that need ACID compliance and rock solid data integrity. 💿:
- Redis - For caching, queues, pub/sub and more - Redis is a versatile tool to have in the toolbox. I like how easy it is to get up and running. 🏃🏻‍♀️:
- Nginx - To quickly proxy and load balance my apps, Nginx is lightweight and reliable. I appreciate how configurable it is too. 🚄:
Outside of code, I enjoy contributing to open source projects :handshake:, learning new technologies :bulb:, and helping fellow developers level up their skills 🌈. Feel free to connect and collab!
